## üìã Railway Deployment Steps

### 1. **Connect Repository to Railway**
1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "Start a New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose your `Servicesbladi_TEST` repository
5. Select the `backend` folder as the root directory

### 2. **Set Environment Variables**
Copy these variables to your Railway project settings:

```bash
# Required Variables
DJANGO_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-django-key-here-make-it-long-and-random

# Database (Railway will auto-generate these)
# PGDATABASE=railway
# PGUSER=postgres
# PGPASSWORD=auto-generated-by-railway
# PGHOST=auto-generated-by-railway
# PGPORT=5432

# Email Configuration (Gmail example)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-gmail-app-password
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=ServicesBladi <your-email@gmail.com>

# Optional: Azure OpenAI (for chatbot)
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your-azure-endpoint
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-azure-api-key

# Optional: Custom domain
ALLOWED_HOST=yourdomain.com
```

### 3. **Add PostgreSQL Database**
1. In Railway dashboard, click "New Service"
2. Select "PostgreSQL"
3. Railway will automatically connect it to your Django app

### 4. **Deploy**
1. Railway will automatically start building and deploying
2. The deployment script will:
   - Install dependencies
   - Collect static files
   - Run migrations
   - Create superuser (admin/admin123)
   - Load initial data
   - Initialize chatbot config

### 5. **Access Your Application**
- Railway will provide a URL like: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`
- Admin panel: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/admin/`
- Default admin credentials: `admin` / `admin123`

## üîê Security Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Change Default Credentials
After deployment, immediately:
1. Login to admin panel with `admin` / `admin123`
2. Change the admin password
3. Create additional admin users as needed
4. Consider removing the default admin user

### üõ°Ô∏è Environment Variables Security
- Never commit real credentials to Git
- Use Railway's environment variables for all secrets
- The app automatically detects Railway environment and switches to production mode

## üîß Configuration Features

### Production vs Development
The app automatically detects Railway environment and configures:
- **Database**: PostgreSQL in production, local in development
- **Debug**: Disabled in production
- **Static Files**: WhiteNoise for Railway
- **Security Headers**: Enabled in production
- **Email**: SMTP in production, console in development
- **Channels**: Redis if available, InMemory fallback

### Automatic Features
- SSL/HTTPS enforcement on Railway
- Static file compression and caching
- Database connection pooling
- Error logging and monitoring
- CORS handling for frontend integration

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions:

1. **Build Fails**
   - Check Python version matches `runtime.txt` (3.13.7)
   - Verify all requirements are in `requirements.txt`

2. **Database Errors**
   - Ensure PostgreSQL service is connected
   - Check database environment variables

3. **Static Files Not Loading**
   - Verify `STATIC_ROOT` and `STATICFILES_DIRS` in settings
   - Check WhiteNoise configuration

4. **Email Not Working**
   - Verify email environment variables
   - For Gmail: use App Password, not regular password
   - Check firewall/port restrictions

5. **Chatbot Not Working**
   - Azure OpenAI credentials required for full functionality
   - App will work without chatbot if credentials not provided

## üìä Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
- Application logs in Railway dashboard
- Database performance and connections
- Static file serving performance
- Email delivery status

## üîÑ Updates

To update your deployed app:
1. Push changes to your GitHub repository
2. Railway will automatically redeploy
3. Database migrations run automatically
4. Static files are recollected
